[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40vechain%2Fconnex.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40vechain%2Fconnex)

## Introduction

Connex is the standard interface to connect DApp with VeChain and user. `Connex` is a set of well-designed APIs for developers, with injected `Connex Object` in web applications they can easily build decentralized applications.

## Get Started 

[Sync](https://github.com/vechain/thor-sync.electron/releases) or other compatible clients will expose `connex` API by an injected object on `Window Object`.

### TypeScript(Recommended)

``` bash
npm install @vechain/connex --save-dev
```

Add `@vechain/connex` to `compilerOptions.types`  in `tsconfig.json` then you are good to go!

### Vanilla JS

No need to set up, just code in your favourite way.

## Usage

``` javascript
const el = document.createElement('h1')
if(window.connex){
    const status = connex.thor.status
    el.innerText = 'You are \'connexed\' to vechain, the status is ' + (status.progress === 1 ? 'synced': 'syncing')
}else{
    el.innerText = ':( seems you don\'t have enough component to launch this app, please ......'
}
document.querySelector('body').append(el)
```
